## Assignment report

I really, really enjoyed this assignment. It was the first time I worked with Express or anything like it, actually. And that has been something that I've 
really looked forward to gaining more knowledge about. It feels like I've learned quite a lot working with this assignment, both in regards to the back end stuff 
like express, and also getting a bit better at the front end bit. I have also not used handlebars before, and it was quite fun too.

### Reflection

The hardest part was getting my head around express itself, how it works overall, "best practices" etc, I guess. Learning how to properly set up and use routes, forwarding data with middleware etc. 

Handlebars didn't feel that complex, but as I hadn't used it before I had to read up a bit about it. But nevertheless it was pretty straight forward to get going.

### Further improvments

I would have liked to expand the platform even more, improving the formatting of the code in the snippets, maybe with automatic syntax hightlighting and such. Proper profile pages, messaging function etc. Making it a bit more like github/gitlab would be cool. Issues etcetc.

### Extras

I implemented the functionality to add tags to the snippets, and to view all the snippets under a specific tag. I also implemented the "user pages", where one can view all the snippets created by a user.

### Feedback

Like mentioned above, I really really enjoyed this assignment as it was both fun and taught me a lot - stuff that I actually feel will benefit me in the future. It could feel a bit daunting at first, having to learn express with all that it entails, but once you get going it feels really rewarding.
